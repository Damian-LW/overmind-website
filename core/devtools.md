# Devtools

## Standalone app

You can start the devtools by using the NPM executor:

```javascript
npx overmind-devtools@latest
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Adding **@latest** just ensures that you break any caching, meaning you will always run the latest version
{% endhint %}

You can also install the devtools with your project, allowing you to lock a specific version of the devtools to your project:

```javascript
npm install overmind-devtools
```

With the package [CONCURRENTLY](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) you can start the devtools as you start your build process:

```text
npm install overmind-devtools concurrently
```

{% code title="package.json" %}
```javascript
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "concurrently \"overmind-devtools\" \"someBuildTool\""
  },
  ...
}
```
{% endcode %}

## VS Code

You can also install the [OVERMIND DEVTOOLS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christianalfoni.overmind-devtools-vscode) extension. This will allow you to work on your application without leaving the IDE at all.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using the **Insiders** version of VSCode the extension will not work. It seems to be some extra security setting.
{% endhint %}

## Connecting from the application

When you create your application it will automatically connect through **localhost:3031**, meaning that everything should just work out of the box. If you need to change the port, connect the application over a network \(mobile development\) or similar, you can configure how the application connects:

```javascript
import {Â createOvermind } from 'overmind'
import { config } from './overmind'

const overmind = createOvermind(config, {
  devtools: '10.0.0.1:3031'
})
```

### Connecting on Chromebook

ChromeOS does not expose localhost as normal. That means you need to connect with **penguin.termina.linux.test:3031**, or you can use the following plugin to forward **localhost:**

## Hot Module Replacement

A popular concept introduced by Webpack is [HMR](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/). It allows you to make changes to your code without having to refresh. Overmind automatically supports HMR. That means when **HMR** is activated Overmind will make sure it updates and manages its state, actions and effects. Even the devtools will be updated as you make changes.

Typically you add this, here showing with React:

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { createOvermind } from 'overmind'
import { Provider } from 'overmind-react'
import { config } from './overmind'
import { App } from './components/App'


const overmind = createOvermind(config)

render(<Provider value={overmind}><App /></Provider>, document.querySelector('#app'))

// Allows this module to run again without refresh,
// meaning "createOvermind" runs again and automatically
// reconfigures
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept()
}
```

Though you can also manually only update Overmind by:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="index.js" %}
```typescript
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { overmind } from './overmindInstance'
import { Provider } from 'overmind-react'
import { App } from './components/App'

render(<Provider value={overmind}><App /></Provider>, document.querySelector('#app'))


```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="overmindInstance.js" %}
```javascript
import { createOvermind } from 'overmind'
import { config } from './overmind'

export const overmind = createOvermind(config)

// When this module runs again "createOvermind" is run
// and it automatically reconfigures
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept()
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
